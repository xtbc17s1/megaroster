# Megaroster

## Day 3 Homework

Finish yesterday's homework, using my Megaroster as a base. Don't forget to keep the `students` array in sync.

### Bonus Credit

Fool around with Foundation and/or CSS to make it look nicer.

### Mega Bonus Credit

Add buttons to change the position of the student within the list. In other words, add "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Persist the student data using `window.localStorage`.

## Day 4 Homework

* Make "move down" work if you haven't already.
* Allow the editing of student names after they're already in the list. (Gee, it would be nice if I could make that span's _content editable_.)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

Have a nice weekend.
